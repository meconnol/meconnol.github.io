            <h2>Who We Are…</h2>
            <p>We are a small business founded in 2020 and based in Northern California. At our core, we are a bakery that is German and French inspired and innovates through global influences. With a vibrant atmosphere, obsessive guest experience, and delicious products, we provide unique and special experiences for everyone who walks through our doors, including our team. </p>
            <h2>Our Values…</h2>
            <p>Integrity, Innovation, Integration. We care about you and the world so we are always looking for the best way to serve. Whether it be through the act of baking itself, working with food shelters, or providing opportunites and scholarships, we want to work with our community to see the best in each other. Without growth and experience there is no movement or room for improvement. We value diversity and inclusion both in the kitchen and out. 
                We are brand ambassadors who genuinely love our food, love our brand, and we’re customer obsessed! Passion runs in the company. 
                We pay attention to our guests, to your role, to detail, to our quality and we are team players!
                We always remember to say hello and thank you. Even those little details can mean the world to our guests and the PTB family.
                It's important to us to always work with a high sense of urgency, with integrity, and as efficiently as we can.
                Service with a smile and happy to help at all times! We want our guests and fellow team members to feel comfortable coming to us for assistance. Smile, have fun, be upbeat and positive with every interaction.
